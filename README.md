A *2026* version of my standards compliant 'Minimal Modular Site'. 

Fully modular and commented for your ease of adaptation to actual use-case. 

CHECK EVERY TODO!

No warranty or guarentee is expressed or implied. 
Use at your own risk. 
It may blow things up or burn them down... that is all on you! 
Read every file, Make sure that everything has been customized BEFORE you deploy your site.

Dont try to blame me for anything, but especially you not reading and your project not working as expected. 

RTFM!

Understood?
